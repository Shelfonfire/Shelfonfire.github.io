# Hey, I'm Dan.

Data Scientist & AI Engineer based in London. I build production ML systems, LLM agents, and apps that solve real problems. Currently Operational Data Lead at TRUSS.

Since early 2024 I've been working at a fashion-tech startup building systems to automatically price every second-hand good — making the resale market more transparent and sustainable. A lot of the most interesting work lives behind closed doors, but I'm always happy to talk about it. [Get in touch](/contact/) if you're curious.
